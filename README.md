# 📜 Teleprompter v2.0.0 Instructions

Welcome to **Teleprompter v2.0.0**!  
This guide walks you through all the features and how to use them effectively.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The teleprompter is designed to mimic a **professional broadcast setup**.  
As you read, a **blue highlight** moves from word to word at the speed you set.

⏸️ You can add pauses in your script. For example:

[pause-3]

This will pause the script for **3 seconds**.  
The **yellow pause icon ❙❙** gives you a heads-up before the pause, and a **large countdown** appears on screen.

📍 Keep your eyes on the **faint red line** at the top of the screen.  
The text scrolls automatically so the highlighted word always stays aligned, allowing you to read naturally without shifting your gaze.

▶ **Play/Pause**

_(Tip: you can also click anywhere on the script text to play or pause.)_

↺ **Reset**

⚙️ **Settings**

## ⏸ Inline Pauses

You can command the teleprompter to **pause automatically** within your script.

**Syntax**  
[pause-X]  
Replace `X` with the number of seconds. Examples: `[pause-5]` or `[pause-0.5]`.

**Visual Cue**  
A yellow pause icon ❙❙ appears next to the word before the pause.

**Countdown**  
When the script reaches the pause, a large **countdown timer** appears on screen.  
The teleprompter resumes automatically when the timer hits zero.
