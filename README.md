# Teleprompter v2.0.0 Instructions

Welcome to **Teleprompter v2.0.0**! This guide walks you through all the features and how to use them effectively.

## How It Works

The teleprompter is designed to mimic a professional broadcast setup. As you read, a blue highlight will move from word to word at the speed you set.

You can add pauses in your script. For example:

[pause-3]

This will pause the script for 3 seconds after that point. The yellow pause icon ❙❙ gives you a heads-up before the script pauses, and a large countdown appears on screen.

Your job is to keep your eyes on the faint red line positioned at the upper part of the screen. The teleprompter will automatically scroll the text to ensure the highlighted word always stays right at that red line, allowing you to read naturally without looking up or down.

## Main Controls (Bottom Center)

**Play/Pause (▶ / ❙❙)**  
Starts or stops the teleprompter. You can also click anywhere on the script text to play or pause.

**Reset (↺)**  
Instantly stops the teleprompter and returns the script to the very beginning.

**Settings (⚙️)**  
Opens or closes the settings panel where you can customize your experience.

## Inline Pauses

You can command the teleprompter to pause automatically within your script.

**Syntax**  
Type `[pause-X]` on its own line, where X is the number of seconds you want to pause.  
Examples: `[pause-5]` or `[pause-0.5]`.

**Visual Cue**  
A yellow pause icon ❙❙ will appear next to the word right before the pause is scheduled.

**Countdown**  
When the script reaches the pause, a large countdown timer will appear on screen. The teleprompter will resume automatically when it hits zero.

## Settings Panel

**Speed**

Adjust these to make the text larger and increase the spacing between lines for better readability.

**Theme**  
Choose between Dark, Light, or High Contrast (yellow/black).

**Mirror Mode**  
Flips the text horizontally (for use with physical teleprompter mirrors).

**Highlight Line**  
Toggles the blue word-by-word highlight on or off.
